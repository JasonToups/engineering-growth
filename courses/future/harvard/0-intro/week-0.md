# Harvard CS50 - Week 0

This is the [first lecture](https://video.cs50.io/1tnj3UCkuxU?screen=LQIiExS3EKg) of the Harvard CS50 Course.

This is the first coursework for week 0 - [Problem Set 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/0/).

## What is Computer Science?
It's about problem solving more generally.

Taking an input, and then returning the expected output.

### Binary Notation
Computers only have the binary to work with of zeroes & ones. 

The ones & zeroes represent on or off.

By turning the switches on & off in patterns, the computer translates that into the language that we write.

### Letters
We have agreed that certain letters are represented by numbers. 

For a letter, we prefix the binary to state that we are going to decode a letter.

### ASCII
American 
Standard 
Code for
Information
Interchange

It was established in the US, so that's why all coding languages are based in the English Alphabet.
