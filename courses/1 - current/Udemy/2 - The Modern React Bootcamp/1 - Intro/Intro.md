## Intro to React
It's a popular frontend framework/library, but at this point, I believe it's a Framework.

Developed by & Sponsored by Facebook. 

### Purpose
Makes it easy to make reusable "view components"

These "encapsulare" logic and HTML into a class.

Often make it easier to build modular applications.

### Goal - Separation of Concerns
The JS, CSS & HTML should be *separate* from the interactive elements.

It's a structure that we build Components within.
## Is React a Framework or Library?

#### Frameworks
- **Front End Frameworks** are larger `JS` libraries.
- Provide "blueprints" for apps.
- "Opinionated"
	- "This is how you should design a JS app"
	- You have to follow certain rules to get the most out of it, like app structure and naming conventions.
- They Often provide code re-use
- They Often provide templating for HTML
- Examples - Angular, Ember, Vue & React?

#### Library or Framework?
The debate has been up in the air for a while, since React Components can exist alongside other frameworks.

The official [React site](https://react.dev/) calls it "The library for web and native user interfaces".

But even though React is a 'library', it's rarely used alone.

It's usually combined with things like React Router, Webpack, etc.

The standard "React Ecosystem" is a framework.
