# Problem Solving Approach

1. Understand the Problem
2. Explore Concrete Examples
3. Break it Down
4. Solve/Simplify
5. Look Back & Refactor

## Look Back & Refactor
Ask interviewers how have other people solved this problem.

When writing a for loop, we can simplify the loop with an of loop, like:

```
for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
  loop
}

//simplify
for (var char or str) {
  loop
}
```

Creating helper functions is a great way to clean up and refactor code.
