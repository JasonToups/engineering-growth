## Outline

- Define what a Singly Linked List is.
- Compare and contrast Linked Lists with Arrays.
- Implement insertion, removal, and traversal methods on Singly Linked Lists.

## Linked List

A **Linked List** is a data structure that contains a **head**, **tail** and **lengthÂ¸** property. 

Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each **node** has a **value** and a **pointer** to another node or *null*.

## Comparisions with Arrays

Lists:
- Do not have indexes!
- Connected via nodes with a **next** pointer.
- Random access is not allowed.

Lists are great for insertion and deletion.

Arrays:
- Indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be access at a specific index
