## Outline & Objectives

- Define what a Singly Linked List is.
- Compare and contrast Linked Lists with Arrays.
- Implement insertion, removal, and traversal methods on Singly Linked Lists.

## Linked List

A **Linked List** is a data structure that contains a **head**, **tail** and **lengthÂ¸** property.

Linked Lists *consists of nodes*, and each **node** has a **value** and a **pointer** to another node or *null*.

There is no index in a linked list, you can't directly reference data by its index number. It's as the terminology suggests, it's a linked list of data.

### Visualizing Data Structures - Linked List

[VisuAlgo.net](https://visualgo.net/en) is a site that helps explain algorithms with visual examples of their data structures.

[VisuAlgo - Linked List](https://visualgo.net/en/list?slide=1)

Linked List is a data structure consisting of a **group of vertice**s (nodes) which *together represent a sequence*. 

Under the simplest form, each vertex is composed of a **data** and a **reference** (link) to the *next vertex in the sequence*. 

Linked List and its variations are used as underlying data structure to implement:

- List
- Stack
- Queue ADTs
- Deque ADTs 
 
> read this [Wikipedia article about ADT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type), if you are not familiar with Abstract Data Types.

## Comparisions with Arrays

Lists:
- Do not have indexes!
- Connected via nodes with a **next** pointer.
- Random access is not allowed.

Lists are great for insertion and deletion.

Arrays:
- Indexed in order!
- Insertion and deletion can be expensive
- Can quickly be access at a specific index
