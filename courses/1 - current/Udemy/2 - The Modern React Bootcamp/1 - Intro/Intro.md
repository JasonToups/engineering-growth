The course videos and exercises are only a part of the experience. In-person bootcamps foster a strong sense of community, and we've tried to replicate that here. To get the most out of the course, **we highly recommend you participate in at least some of the following places:**

1. [Join the discord chat](https://www.coltsteele.com/discord) - it's a very active community with thousands of students
2. [Subscribe to the Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrqAGUPPMOdo0jfQ6grikZw) for additional content, live streams, AMAs with me, and more!

These "encapsulare" logic and HTML into a class.

Often make it easier to build modular applications.
