# Coursework

The course is structured the same as his 3 week course on Data Structures & Algorithms.

It would be a good idea to try to complete this by the end of May.

Take notes for each course & put them in the section folders.

Create project scaffolds in each folder with working code & run it in VSCode Live Server.
