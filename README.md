# Engineering Growth

Here I'm documenting and building small projects to grow as a developer.

There are folders for the `courses` I'm currently taking, where I'll make specific notes for the coursework.

Then there's the `documentation` folder where I abstract what I've learned from the courses into specific documentation on different topics.

I've created this repo to track my progress and share what I've learned.
